<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I primarily deal with the Salesforce ecosystem as a Solutions Engineer but I am currently working on expanding my skills!</p>

<p>I started my post Secondary Education in Web Development and Design and I've recently really wanted to get back into it after being away from it for 10 years.</p>
